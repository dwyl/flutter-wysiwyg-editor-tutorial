# Why? ü§∑‚Äç

On our [`app`](https://github.com/dwyl/app),
people will add their todo items.
To do so, they *need* a capable editor
that is easy-to-use that also supports
customization
(new buttons).

# What? üí≠

When typing text,
the person using should be able to edit/format it
to their heart's content 
and customize it to their liking.

This repo will showcase an introduction
of a `WYSIWYG` Rich Text editor 
that can be used on both mobile and web devices.
We want this editor to be *extensible*, 
meaning that we want to add specific features
and *introduce them* to the person
incrementally.


# Who? üë§

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
or anyone who is interested in learning 
more about building a `WYSIWYG` editor.

# _How_? üë©‚Äçüíª

## Prerequisites? üìù

This demo assumes you have foundational knowledge of `Flutter`.
If this is your first time tinkering with `Flutter`,
we suggest you first take a look at 
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter.

In the linked repo, you will learn 
how to install the needed dependencies
and how to debug your app on both an emulator
or a physical device.


## 0. Project setup

To create a new project in `Flutter`,
follow the steps in 
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter#0-setting-up-a-new-project.

After completing these steps,
you should have a boilerplate `Flutter` project.

If you run the app, you should see the template Counter app.
The tests should also run correctly.
Executing `flutter test --coverage` should yield
this output on the terminal.

```sh
00:02 +1: All tests passed!   
```

This means everything is correctly set up!
We are ready to start implementing!

### **Make sure your `flutter` is up-to-date!

Make sure you are running the latest version of `Flutter`!
You can make a run-through of the versions by running:

```
flutter doctor
```

To make sure you're running the latest version,
run `flutter upgrade`.

This is needed when running the app against physical devices.
A *minimum `SDK` version* is needed to run the project with its dependencies
so you don't encounter this error:

```
uses-sdk:minSdkVersion XX cannot be smaller than version XX declared in library
```

If you are *still* encountering this problem on your physical device,
please follow the instructions in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52060516/flutter-how-to-change-android-minsdkversion-in-flutter-project.
You will essentially need to change the `minSdkVersion` parameter
inside `android/app/build.gradle` file 
and bump it to a higher version (it is suggested in the error output).


## 1. Installing all the needed dependencies

To implement our application that runs `flutter_quill`, 
we are going to need install some dependencies 
that we're going to be using.

- [`flutter_quill`](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill), 
the main package with the text editor
with Delta capabilities.
- [`flutter_quill_extensions`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions), 
needed to use image and video embeds into the editor,.
- [`file_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker),
so we're able to import files.
- [`universal_io`](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_io),
an extended version of `dart.io` that works on all platforms.
- [`universal_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_html),
extended version of `dart.html` that is cross-platform.
- [`responsive_framework`](https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_framework),
package that will make it easier to make our `Flutter` app responsive.
- [`path`](https://pub.dev/packages/path)
and [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider),
needed to find the path of chosen images.

To install of these packages, 
head over to `pubspec.yaml`
and inside the `dependencies` section,
add the following lines:

```dart
  flutter_quill: ^7.3.3
  flutter_quill_extensions: ^0.4.0
  file_picker: ^5.3.3
  universal_io: ^2.2.2
  responsive_framework: ^1.1.0
  universal_html: ^2.2.3
  path: ^1.8.3
  path_provider: ^2.1.0
```

And run `flutter pub get` to download these dependencies.


## 2. Setting up the responsive framework

Now that we have all the dependencies we need,
let's start by setting up all the needed breakpoints
from the `responsive_framework`
to make our app responsive 
and *conditionally show elements*
according to the device size.

Head over to `main.dart`
and paste the following:

```dart
import 'package:app/home_page.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_framework/responsive_framework.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(App(
    platformService: PlatformService(),
  ),);
}

/// Entry gateway to the application.
/// Defining the MaterialApp attributes and Responsive Framework breakpoints.
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({required this.platformService, super.key});

  final PlatformService platformService;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Editor Demo',
      builder: (context, child) => ResponsiveBreakpoints.builder(
        child: child!,
        breakpoints: [
          const Breakpoint(start: 0, end: 425, name: MOBILE),
          const Breakpoint(start: 426, end: 768, name: TABLET),
          const Breakpoint(start: 769, end: 1440, name: DESKTOP),
          const Breakpoint(start: 1441, end: double.infinity, name: '4K'),
        ],
      ),
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.white),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: HomePage(platformService: platformService),
    );
  }
}

/// Platform service class that tells if the platform is web-based or not
class PlatformService {
  bool isWebPlatform() {
    return kIsWeb;
  }
}
```

Let's break this down!

- inside `main()`, we initialize the app 
by passing a `platformService`,
our own small [stubbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub)
class that will allow us to check in tests whether the device
is mobile or desktop-based.
- our app is wrapped in `MaterialApp`.
In the `builder` parameter,
we define the `responsive_framework` breakpoints
to conditionally render widgets according to the device's size.
- we define the `HomePage` in the `home` parameter.
This `HomePage` class is not yet defined.

This will fail because `home_page.dart` is not defined.
Let's do that! üòÄ


## 3. Create `HomePage` with basic editor

In `lib`, create a file called `home_page.dart`
and paste the following code.

```dart
/// Importing all the needed imports so the README is easier to follow
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:ui';

import 'package:app/main.dart';
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill/extensions.dart';
import 'package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart' hide Text;
import 'package:flutter_quill_extensions/flutter_quill_extensions.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';


/// Home page with the `flutter-quill` editor
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const HomePage({
    required this.platformService, super.key,
  });

  final PlatformService platformService;

  @override
  HomePageState createState() => HomePageState();
}

class HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {

  /// `flutter-quill` editor controller
  QuillController? _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    /// Loading widget if controller's not loaded
    if (_controller == null) {
      return const Scaffold(body: Center(child: Text('Loading...')));
    }

    /// Returning scaffold with editor as body
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        elevation: 0,
        centerTitle: false,
        title: const Text(
          'Flutter Quill',
        ),
      ),
      body: Container(),
    );
  }
}
```

We are importing all the needed imports
right off the bat so we don't have to deal with those later üòâ.

In this file, 
we are simply creating a basic **stateful widget** `HomePage`
that renders a `Scaffold` widget
with a `Container()` as its body.

You might have noticed we've defined a 
[**`QuillController`**](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/blob/36d72c1987f0cb8d6c689c12542600364c07e20f/lib/src/widgets/controller.dart)
`_controller`.
This controller will keep track of the
**`deltas`** 
and the **text** that is written in the editor.

> [!NOTE]  
> `Deltas` is an object format that represents
> contents and changes in a readable way.
> To learn about them, we *highly suggest* visiting
> https://quilljs.com/docs/delta.

For the Quill Editor to properly function,
we are going to use this `_controller` parameter later on.
